<p>The Rock of Gibraltar. Derived from the Arabic name Jebel Tariq.</p>
<p>Both of the pillars are named after the two great Umayyad conquerors of Visigothic Hispania, Musa bin Nusayr and Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād.</p>
<p>Those who would become known as the Moors were the first to settle Gibraltar. However, the rest of Spain was not so empty.</p>

			<p>While the Romans in the province of Hispania knew of the Columna Ercole from the Phoenecian and Egyptian sailors before them, Gibraltar was first settled long after the fall of the Roman Empire by those who would become known as the Moors.</p>
			<div id="one"><img id="sng" src="images\PillarsHerculesPeutingeriana.jpg" width="33%" height="33%"></div>
			<p>It was the invading warriors of the Umayyad Caliphate that crossed the Strait and established the first permanent residence and fortress in Gibraltar.</p>

			<p>Several centuries later, the Umayyad Caliphate would collapse into the, leaving behind the Caliphate of Cordoba in Andalusia.</p>
			<p>Soon after, the Caliphate of Cordoba itself fell to the Fitna of Al-Andalus. They were conquered by the Almohad Caliphate, which itself fell into disarray in the High Medieval Period.</p>

			<p>Taking advantage of the chaos in Al-Andalus, the Crown of Castile expanded at their expense with the help of foreign crusaders.</p>
			<p>By the 14th century, the Moors' days were already numbered. Granada would hold out for centuries after the rest of the Moors were subjugated in the Reconquista.</p>
			<p>Many Spanish kings fell to plague, battle, and ill-planned stratagems in trying to wrest control of Gibraltar from Granada. During the Fifth Siege of Gibraltar in 1350, King Alfonxo XI of Castile succumbed to the bubonic plague. It took until the Eighth Siege of Gibraltar in 1462 for it to finally be conquered, at which point there was so little resistance that the two Spanish lords nearly came to blows over who should have the honor of taking the castle.</p>

			<p>Around that year, the balance of power of the Mediterranean would shift drastically when Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile married to form Union of Castile and Aragon. They were arguably the most influential power couple. After the conquest of Granada in 1491, they would change the balance of power for the entire world by taking the Reconquista to the New World in 1492.</p>

				<p>As the discovery and colonization of the New World got under way, Gibraltar became an extremely important stopping point for Spanish ships returning from and embarking on the Atlantic voyage.</p>

				<p>Of course, such a vital strategic point could not go uncontested. During the Eighty Years War and the War of Spanish Succession, the Protestant nations of Great Britain and the United Provinces struggled against the Catholic Spanish Empire for control. In 1704, the Grand Alliance would finally prevail in Gibraltar.</p>

				<p>Isolated and completely surrounded by the the ocean and their enemies, the British in Gibraltar would fortify the Rock with siege tunnels.<p>

				<p>Gibraltar soon ended up what was essentially a British colony, far from home, a status which remains to this day.</p>
